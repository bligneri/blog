### Find the courage to be disliked.

Now, in Adler's terms, you need to develop **the courage to be disliked**. Once you have identified the type of situation/persons/activities/objects/experiences that causes this behaviour, you can start working on a plan. You must gather the courage to recognize that you are 100% responsible for these selfing episodes. After all, all these dramas happen in your mind and … in your mind only. You will dislike your self. And your change of attitude will most certainly cause others to dislike you (they prefered your old self!).

Agree that you will change your behaviour and:

* Make peace with your parents for not taking you to your grandmother's burial ceremony 39 years ago! They were trying to protect you from grief. Congrats! You can now enjoy your family's Christmas holidays!
* Each time you see a Tesla, you can thank the unknown Tesla owner for his outstanding contribution to the environment … but also implement a saving plan to get one and work with your boss to ensure you will get your next raise!
* You can tell your co-worker you have heard the story for the 23rd time. It is of no interest to you and the team during the meeting. Then redirect the group's attention to the objective of the meeting. Accept that your relationship with your co-worker will be most certainly altered forever…

### All problems are interpersonal relationship problems

Our leading cause of unhappiness is how we interact with others. Our selfing habits create it.

To cite [Alfred Adler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfred_Adler) a co-founder of the modern psychology (Sigmund Freud contemporary):

All problems are interpersonal relationship problems.– Alfred Adler### We live in a society of possession

The dominant political and economic model is a mental model of possession. Your possessions define you.

You have been trained very early on to conform to this primary success indicator: at school, college, university and your job. You have been told to respect the one who possesses more than you (your teacher, professor, boss, millionaire, billionaire, etc.). It implicitly correlates to less respect for the ones who own less than you. This is the basis of our social and professional hierarchies. You are also well aware that this hierarchy is part of your relations with friends and family.

The Internet just added another category of possession. Virtual possessions. Social networks are now the new dominant metric for our world of possession. They measure your influence very precisely: how many followers do you have? How many views? Likes? Responses? And, like money, you were trained to have more. To want more. Virtual social recognition precedes money. Influencers can make a living our of their life tasks. Like the primate alpha male, we look at their possessions full of envy, and we want to imitate them (and buy everything they use!).

### Addiction is everywhere

The habit-forming process is governed by the trigger, expectation and reward dopamine system. We are addicted to our cravings for these experiences of possession. The associated dopamine release is extremely powerful, and we are in an automated mode much more than we know.

Our mental models of the world that is driving these behaviours rely on the connexions made between millions of neurones. Think about a behaviour you have done 10 000 times already without even thinking about it. If you hit your facebook/linkedin/TikTok/etc. feed 30 times/day and have been doing it for one year: 10 000 hits. If you’ve been doing it for five years, 50 000 hits.

Lots of books and resources exist on behaviour/habit-forming patterns as well as addiction. There is a scientific consensus that the first step is recognizing that we have a problem (Awareness), then accept our own behaviour and finally decide to take action.

#### Timeless wisdom to look for to develop self-acceptance and growth

At some point, as you become less reactive and more open, you will have more space in your life to think carefully about yourself. From the Maslow pyramid above, you will start to look for self-actualization.

> If we want to get along with ourselves, we must not drive, criticize, frighten, or fight ourselvesDreikurs and Mosak (1967)

In other words, a person must get along with herself/himself as it is a prerequisite to get along with others.
