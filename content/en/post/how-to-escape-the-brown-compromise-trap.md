# How to Escape the brown compromise trap

## We are all painters

The brown compromise is an analogy from the painting world. The story goes like this: if you ask a family of five folks living in the same house which colour they prefer, you may end up with a dataset like this one: green, yellow, blue, violet, and I don’t care (yes, this is not a colour!). You may also end up in a family (like mine) where one of the users (me!) is colour-blind and has a very different perception of the world than the other four family members.

If you don’t apply any other criteria and respect everybody’s preference, you will end up with a brown colour of some sort. More or less dark. You can also spice up the model and use more or less complex weight-scaling and even advanced mathematics, but you will end up in various forms of brown as you add more people to the group. I also noticed that nobody says `white` and that most houses tend to have lots of white/clear colours. Of course, in real life, very few houses are painted brown.

This type of decision-making also happens in a business context, especially in the product and design world. When you share a design document of any type (i.e: wireframe, Figma, design doc, product brief, PRD, press release/FAQ, etc.) … you will receive feedback. The feedback is used to decide either a go/no go decision or some more nuanced decision (scope, architecture, etc.).

Usually, given four stakeholders, you will most certainly receive different types of feedback
I don’t care, but when can you ship it [I want your team to work on another project that has not yet been prioritized!]
I will never use this [this is terrible, don’t ship it!]
Can you also do X and Y while revisiting this flow?
I hate it you should do B instead.

The feedback comes from various folks you must please, including stakeholders, direct or indirect reports, peers, etc. And quite often, the main strategy to get this initiative/project moving is the brown compromise: the teams deals with all these influences by trying to please everyone. For instance, given the feedback above, the team will incorporate into their `A` project a bit of X, a bit of Y and also more B. Doing this will lead to a `brown compromise` that does not meet anyone’s need and is complex, hard to explain, super expensive to build, support and maintain. The business impact will be low (if any).

## Why do we agree to it?

Three main reasons. Each is psychological and directly linked to behaviour/habits related to our desires to please, serve authority and belong.

1. **Desire to [blindly] please others**: We are afraid of the tension and negative emotions that arise in us when we disagree with people we love and respect.  The other person who respects and/or loves you also has the same behaviour. Without a shared and strong commitment to being radically candid with each other, this fear of our negative reaction is a root cause for the brown compromise between humans.
1. **Desire to [blindly] respect authority**: We were all taught (kindergarten, school. College, university, parents, family, etc.) to respect authority from a very young age. When an authority figure proposes something, we are very reluctant to confront this proposal directly. Open communication, trust and a safe space are hard prerequisites empowering us to be radically candid with our managers or authority figures..
1. **Group thinking**:  Group thinking is connected to our deepest fear as human beings: the fear of being rejected from the group. In primitive societies, being rejected from the group (banishment) was a death sentence!  It creates, for every group member, extreme pressure to conform. To be nice to the group, everyone will tend to stay centred around what is agreed upon.  The alpha of the group will help the group to come up with a brown compromise: his goal is to remain the alpha, and he does not care much about the compromise as long as the group remains together and grows.

## The Brown compromise in a work environment: Product Management case study

In a professional environment, you are rarely the sole decision maker. For instance, a typical product team includes engineers, designer(s) and a product manager. Sometimes it includes additional profiles like product marketing, data, and other specialties, depending on the team's needs (legal, security, etc.).
