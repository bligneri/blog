# The ticketing system user interface is an antipattern for cross-team collaboration

Humans crave connection and collaboration with others. We want to belong. This is a fundamental and universal need shared by most primates. Remote humans must intentionally create causes to connect with other remote humans. The usual tools include virtual ☕chats, spending quality time, regular 1:1, #random channels, #health, #cooking, #music and other #interest-based channels where we learn and exchange with other human beings conversationally. We like to share (some) personal details with co-workers so that they can understand us better. Other wonderful human beings, sharing with us their unique story, build empathy, understanding and trust. 

While dated, the [Agile Manifesto](http://agilemanifesto.com/) explicitly captures this universal need: `People and their relationship over processes and tools`.

The more I use them (personally and professionally), the more I perceive the dehumanization of the requester into some data bits that fit nicely into a form. Ticketing systems are a clear way to say: I don’t have time to listen to or understand your needs. Please take your ticket number and wait. 
Actors and scope of this article
=> Diagram
Cross-functional team: a team of professionals from diverse horizons (for instance engineers, product managers, designers, etc.) working to achieve a positive outcome for the organization.

Specialized team: A team that has no representation in the cross-functional team.

Requester: An individual from the cross-functional submitting a ticket on behalf of the cross-functional team.
 
What is not covered in this article?
### Ticketing systems for support:
Ticketing systems for support teams are different and not covered in this article. Ticketing systems for support have become a norm in society and are a widely used user interface. This being said, UX designers are well aware that the best user interfaces do not require users to create a support ticket. The best experience for us humans is either self-service or talking to another human (or AI?). Support is not about cross-team collaboration and solving ambiguous issues. Support is all about homeostasis: the system/product does not behave as expected, and we have a very good definition of the state of the fully functional system. The purpose of the ticket is always the same: to re-establish the normal state as fast as we can.
Internal cross-functional team ticketing system
If a team decides, of its own volition, to use an internal ticketing system to be more efficient and if the team has control over how they can adapt this productivity tool, then this is also excluded from this article. 

If the team has no control over the ticketing system and if that system is imposed on them, this article may be relevant. 
Three reasons it is an anti-pattern for cross-team collaboration
1 - It causes a contextual information collapse 
In a cross-team effort, context is king. Concepts and ideas about the future are notoriously hard to share. Even if you have created lots of artifacts to share your context (product brief, design doc, prototype, user interviews, etc.) and even if you take the time to add all these artifacts into your request (which usually is if not impossible then very hard/time consuming to do), you have no idea what will be done with this content. Will someone even access it?

Every ticketing system forces a complete collapse of the context. It coerces the requester to comply with the view of the world of the ticketing system owner. For instance: short description, priority, is it blocking, which team, etc. As a requester, you can add context to the request but … will it be used? How? Will it still be accurate in one week? One month?

Some specialized teams even prevent any conversation from happening… before you create a ticket.

## Clear requests are incompatible with serious discovery work
Ticketing system deals very poorly with the reality of our millennium. I don’t know.

* I don’t know generates, by nature, lots of ambiguity:
* I don’t know what the expert team I am addressing a ticket needs to do.
* I don’t even know if this is an urgent problem.
* I don’t know if it is a known problem. Are we already working on it?
* I don’t know if what I am doing will help or hinder the efforts of the team owning the ticketing system.
* I don’t know … should I create a ticket?


For instance, I have direct experience and some qualitative data (user interviews) that we have a user experience  issue while using one of our product flows. I don’t know why, and I don’t know what to do exactly: is it because of the cognitive dissonance as we use different terms for the same concepts? Is it because I just read out SEO and google ads, and there is a dissonance here? Is it because the information architecture does not meet my needs? Is it because of our colour scheme, which, in my culture, is associated with death? Is it because it took 2 minutes to build my new project? Is it because our product does not match our new branding and messaging framework? Etc.

Should I create a ticket for the design team? For the marketing team? For the engineering team (performance issue?)? All of them? Who will understand something if I create all these tickets?

Said simply, it would be tough to make a clear request in this case without exchanging lots of information with a few folks (including lots of contexts discussed in point 1 above). 

## The ticketing system's user interface harms mental health: relationships are more important than transactions!

Good relationship -> transactions feel more and more natural and conversational -> it improves the relationship
Neutral, inexisting, negative relationships -> each transaction takes a toll on the relationship and decreases the interest to make more transaction with the other party (friction, frustration, unmet needs, etc.) -> it deteriorates the relationship -> fewer transactions -> no more relationship

Now the challenge with ticketing systems is that they are purely transactional. 

Sometimes, you can not talk to someone until you have created a ticket. 

Can you tell me about a single experience when, professionally or personally, having to wait in line to ask a question (in the physical world but also via phone/email/or filling a form on the Web) did improve your relationship with this organization or team? 
If your question was easily answered by the other person (after a 10 minute/1 hour/1 week wait), how did you feel?
If your question was hard and ambiguous and the answer was … I can not help you, how did you feel?
What if your question was answered with a case number and a nice: 
Thank you, we may come back to you if we need additional information. Don’t call us back
We may or may not take care of your request in the future (or never!) depending on our team bandwidth and prioritization of your question.

There is a systemic problem here:
How can you create a meaningful relationship if you can only do shitty transactions that force you to collapse the context of everything you know on unclear requests that are intrinsically ambiguous with an unknown waiting list of humans, priorities and processes and you have zero control and visibility?

By the way, there is a complete field of study dedicated to these problems: User Experience (UX). The concept is quite simple to understand but very hard to implement: you build a system around the needs of your users. You don’t coerce/force your users to use a system you build for the needs of your organizations. You don’t ask users for information that is not useful to meet your users needs. You don’t show a user interface (UI) with grey or dark patterns to manipulate the behaviour of your users: you want your users to make informed decisions thanks to a great system that helps them succeed. You measure the success of your UI with regular satisfaction surveys, user interviews and other feedback loops.

If the ticketing system interface was so great, we would use it everywhere including with our friends, our family and our loved ones. Tickets create friction, without a well-established and healthy relationship, they decrease the quality of the relationship and make the requester feel dumber and dumber as he needs to create more and more tickets or write lengthy answers to some questions asked by the ticketing system owner (that is an expert in a field not familiar to the requester!).

This is why most products today are self-service: users are smart, and if the user experience is great and frictionless they only have to create tickets occasionally when the system does not behave as expected (Support Tickets). 
4 - I am convinced. What can I do to avoid these problems?
What can you do to solve this anti-pattern? There are no silver bullets. As you will see this is fundamentally a leadership (prioritization) and organizational design problem. 

Here are three impactful possible solutions:


The ideal solution is to change the composition of the cross-functional team to add another specialty. If you can do this, you should. For instance, for a typical product team: can you add a full-time data scientist? Can you add a full-time Product Marketing Manager? It suppresses the need for any user interface to work collaboratively with these other teams..


If you can not have a full-time human joining the cross-functional team, maybe you can have at least half of his time committed to the cross-functional team? For instance, a data scientist or product marketing manager working on two product areas? 

I would not recommend segmenting below the half-time commitment because it would be very hard for someone to follow and work with a team if they can not attend the team rituals and move as fast as the team. In my experience, the ability to maintain alignment drops rapidly (very fast for junior members, more slowly for senior members who can sometimes manage 3-4 team-memberships simultaneously).


If you do not have part-time contributors, then you have a problem. It is a prioritization problem and an organizational design problem: leadership is not ready to commit, and there is a siloed organizational design that hinders cross-team collaboration. 

One or more specialized teams are being silently overcommitted on multiple fronts. In this context, the cross-team collaboration will suffer and it will create problems that will lead directly to lower velocity, lower impact, and lower employee morale. This is a negative feedback loop. Work with your leadership to help them understand their responsibility and how to improve (see the conclusion for an experiment to get there rapidly!).

5 - Do’s and don’t for less inefficient cross-team collaboration via a ticketing system

Let’s imagine none of the solutions presented above worked or there are already a few ticketing systems in place in your organizations that hinder cross-team collaboration. Send this article to the ticketing system owner: there are still some things that can be done without changing too much the existing processes and tools to create and prevent the deterioration of human-to-human relationships between siloed teams using a ticketing system to communicate.
5.1 - Enable cross-team members to discuss before ticket creation!
Please do something like Office Hours. The specialized team can have a few weekly events (across timezones if you are distributed) where folks from the specialized team are available, and potential requesters come on with exploratory questions and don’t use the ticketing system to connect with the specialized team. The goal here is to build the relationship (first and foremost) and then to share context between the cross-functional team and the specialized team.

It usually meets the needs of the specialized team (connection, meaning, clarity, managing their time/effort) and the needs of the cross-functional team members (connection, collaboration, being heard, being understood). It focuses on the human to human relation: two worlds are connected in a very efficient way so that each human builds and strengthens healthy human-to-human connections.
5.2 - Have a member of the specialized team write the initial request

The requester has a lot of contexts that the specialized team does not have. The requester usually represents a cross-functional team and the cross-functional team is working on hard and ambiguous questions developing their own language and mental models. It is impossible to summarize in a ticket.

The preferred way is to explain the cross-functional team needs to a specialized team member.  The specialized team member (maybe one we have exchanged with during office hours?) can develop a good understanding of the cross-functional team and rapidly assess the size of the request. With this information, a discussion can happen, before a ticket is created, with the potential requested: given the efforts, is it something worth pursuing? If it is, then specialized team members can write the ticket.

In human-to-human interaction, this is called active listening: I repeat to you what I have understood of your needs. If the request is unclear, the requester can either clarify it directly in the ticketing system or meet the specialized team member to clarify. This back-and-forth happens until both sides have a shared agreement that this is accurate and valuable. It really is like a regular conversation between human beings. 

The ticket only captures the outcome of this conversation and reflects a shared alignment regarding what is achievable (feasibility comes from the specialized team member) and the real value (from the requester representing the cross-functional team’s need).

It is a win-win situation: the specialized team member is an expert in its field and also an expert ticketing system user as well as a prioritization process expert for this ticketing system. He knows very well the processes to prioritize and can advise the requester. Quite often, based on past experiences, the specialized team member can also provide a meaningful estimate and even, sometimes, a tacit engagement (assuming no urgent request)..
5.3 - Create a feedback loop for your internal specialized team ticketing system
It is a fundamental principle of nature: systems without feedback loop diverge. What is the feedback loop of the specialized team ticketing system?

Many companies measure the NPS score of their customers or the employee NPS score of their employees. Most are doing user research or focus groups. Most support ticketing systems have surveys where the support ticketing system owner can understand the system's performance from the user's point of view. Cross-functional agile teams do regular retrospectives and improve relationships, processes and tools (including the ticketing system performance).

What about your specialized ticketing system: are you surveying your users? Are you asking them what they think of the ticketing system? Are they happy and fully engaged when they use your ticketing system? Do they have ideas to improve the ticketing system? Do you have a user group to help everyone improve this system?

Without this kind of retroaction, the specialized ticketing system is doomed to fail and create silos. Simply because this is a one-sided UI, a black box with dark patterns and no improvement loop to fix any potential shortcomings.There is no perfect design, no perfect UI, no perfect system and certainly no perfect ticketing system: trade-offs have to be made to balance contradictory criteria like usability, efficiency, prioritization, quality of the answers, etc.
Is leadership aware: a practical experiment for leaders
Most leaders have no direct experience of how these systems work
Part of each leader’s role is to ensure clear prioritization as well as global efficiency for the organization you are contributing to. You may be super pleased to get wonderful reports about all the internal ticketing systems “performance” in your company but as a leader, you should answer this question: is it working? Is it the best we can do? Is it helping or hindering our goals? Is it improving or decreasing employee engagement and morale?

Unfortunately, leaders are, for the most part, completely unaware and not accustomed to the cross-team collaboration internal processes. Most of them have never used such a system! When (senior) leaders express an ambiguous request that requires specialized team collaboration, a cross-functional task force is assembled with a single owner. 

=> Leaders systematically bypass every internal ticketing system. 

Their request was easily prioritized and deemed important (usually with a negotiable deadline and negotiable scope to deal with the ambiguity). Dedicated human beings, all experts in their field, are assigned to a cross-functional team to make rapid progress and come back with a high-quality solution. 

How to experience what everybody else experiences in the company?

In the product and design world, we call this type of measurement 'dogfooding' or `eating your own dog food`. Every product team member should use the product they are building on a regular basis. In this case, the product is the complex organization: its people, priorities, processes and tools. Let’s focus on the ticketing system (a tool that encapsulates prioritization and processes).

For one week, rely exclusively upon the interfaces available to other members of the organization. Use every internal ticketing system(s) for every cross-team collaboration. For instance, each time you need information from a team that is not yours: use the ticketing system. When someone from another team requires something from you, refer this person to the process/ticketing system used by your team. Answer the need of this person using the same system as your team (the specialized ticketing system). Take notes and share with your peers your findings. 

To check on progress, do this exercise every quarter and include your measurement results in the QBR of your department or company. 


Leaders are responsible for every human, every priority as well as every process and tool deployed by the company to meet their business objectives. They are designers of the organization. Like any design, no organization is perfect and leaders have to make trade-offs between goals. Some structures favour the achievement but prevent others. Measuring the consequences of the prioritization and organizational design choices is key to make sure the trade-offs are still the correct ones considering the current state of the company.

You don’t want to invest the time. No problem. In the product world, it is called `discovery`. Talk to the users of your product: every employee. Focus on individual contributors without any managerial role and ask them questions about how they collaborate with other teams. Ask them to show you their work, processes, workflows and tickets. New users have quite often a very valuable point of view. After three months, talk to new hires. What about cross-team collaboration? How is it working for you? What would you change to make it easier for you to be impactful? Open questions.This method is usually complementary to the direct experience. The difference is that you will empathize with the users and more easily access their feelings and discover their needs (while if you test yourself, this will be your own feelings and your own needs).

Conclusion:
Because internal ticketing systems for cross-team collaboration are an anti-pattern for collaboration, you should make dedicated efforts to stop using this user interface for cross-team collaboration. You need to discuss this with your leadership, and propose the experiences proposed above so that they can really understand the trade-offs they are optimizing with the current prioritization, processes and tools.

Partial mitigations include
Ensuring that high-priority initiatives have specialized members in the team so that they don’t have to rely on these ticketing systems
If resources are not sufficient, negotiate part-time membership (but not less!)

If those solutions are not applicable or if these changes take time, you may well be stuck with the anti-pattern for a while: you have to use a ticketing system for cross-team collaboration. 

Here are three softeners that you may want to use in order to mitigate some of the most negative consequences of this anti-pattern:
Don’t prevent discussion before a ticket is created: office hours, etc.)
Have the specialized team member write the ticket and practice active listening 
Create a feedback loop with the users for each specialized ticketing system

Keep in mind that these softeners will not fix the problem. Continue to work with your leadership to focus on the most important areas and assemble a fully-autonomous cross-functional team that can tackle the important and hard problem prioritized by the company with minimal outside help.
