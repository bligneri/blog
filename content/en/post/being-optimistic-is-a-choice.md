## Definition

Here is the dictionary definition: **an optimist is one who usually expects a favourable outcome**. While this does not seem like much, words are essential.

1. There is no obligation to _always_ expects a favorable outcome
2. Favourable is a very ambiguous term: favourable for _you_? _others?_, the _earth's ecosystem?_, the _universe_.

This definition is quite helpful because, as often, it is very nuanced. This is fully compatible with the pursuit of happiness: you can sometimes be pessimistic about any given outcome (no stress!). _Usually_, with wisdom (and an examined life), you can redefine favourably as _you_ see fit.

The most efficient lifelong lessons come with a direct and very real immediate negative outcome. For instance: a car accident, sports injury, significant failure, or losing a loved one. Optimists will consider all aspects of this event and redefine the situation (or the story) to find a positive outcome.

## A choice
Being optimistic is a choice. An optimist in action looks for a reframing of any adverse situations. This can happen immediately, but more often than not this requires a heavy dose of introspection and soul searching.
