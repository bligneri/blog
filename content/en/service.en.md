I offer fractional services (CPO, CTO or CPTO) for start-ups and scale-ups having either a punctual need or who want to work long-term with me.

I take an active role with the leadership team (CEO, CFO, founders, etc.) to deliver value. Given my background, I can operate as a fractional CTO/CPO or both.
Fractional means that I have all the active responsibilties of a regular employee including a managerial role (hiring, promoting, firing) depending on the size of the team.
